# Models Directory

This directory is intended to store trained machine learning models used by the face recognition system.

Examples include:
- Face detection models
- Face recognition (embedding) models
- Other AI/ML models for suspicious activity detection

Models should be organized into subdirectories if there are multiple types or versions.
