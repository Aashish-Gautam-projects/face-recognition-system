# Software Requirement Specification (SRS)  
## Enterprise Network Traffic Monitoring & Control Tool (MVP)  

---

## 1. Introduction  

### 1.1 Purpose  
The purpose of this document is to define the requirements for the **Enterprise Network Traffic Monitoring & Control Tool (MVP)**.  
This tool will provide enterprises with the ability to monitor, analyze, and control real-time network traffic across Linux and Windows environments.  

### 1.2 Scope  
The MVP will enable:  
- Real-time monitoring of inbound and outbound traffic.  
- Dashboard with traffic analytics (bandwidth, protocols, applications).  
- Basic traffic control (block, allow, throttle).  
- Alerts & notifications for abnormal activity.  
- Multi-platform support (Linux, Windows).  

This tool is intended for IT admins, network engineers, and enterprises that require visibility into network usage and control over data flow.  

### 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations  
- **MVP**: Minimum Viable Product  
- **UI**: User Interface  
- **API**: Application Programming Interface  
- **Bandwidth**: Data transfer capacity  

### 1.4 References  
- IEEE SRS standards  
- Wireshark, Nagios, pfSense (reference tools)

## 2. Overall Description  

### 2.1 Product Perspective  
This tool will act as a standalone platform with optional API integration for enterprise systems. It will collect and process network traffic data using packet sniffing and system APIs.  

### 2.2 Product Features  
- **Traffic Monitoring**: Capture real-time traffic by IP, port, protocol.  
- **Visualization**: Dashboard with charts/graphs of bandwidth usage.  
- **Control Mechanisms**: Block, allow, throttle connections.  
- **Alerts**: Notify admin on unusual traffic or suspicious activity.  
- **Reports**: Export usage statistics in CSV/PDF.  

### 2.3 User Classes and Characteristics  
- **Admin Users**: Full control over monitoring & blocking.  
- **Read-only Users**: Can view reports & analytics.  
- **Super Admins**: Manage system settings & roles.  

### 2.4 Operating Environment  
- **OS**: Linux (Ubuntu, CentOS), Windows 10/11/Server  
- **Backend**: Python (Flask/Django)  
- **Database**: PostgreSQL / MySQL  
- **Frontend**: React.js with TailwindCSS  

### 2.5 Constraints  
- Must work in real-time with minimal latency.  
- MVP should handle at least 1000 concurrent connections.  
- Limited to on-premise deployment for security reasons.  

### 2.6 Assumptions and Dependencies  
- Users have admin/root privileges to install and configure.  
- Reliable system clock synchronization.  
- Proper network driver/API access.

## 3. Specific Requirements  

### 3.1 Functional Requirements  
1. **Traffic Monitoring**  
   - Capture network traffic (IP, Port, Protocol, Bandwidth).  
   - Show top talkers (high bandwidth users).  

2. **Visualization**  
   - Real-time graphs of bandwidth usage.  
   - Filter by device, IP, protocol, or time range.  

3. **Control Mechanisms**  
   - Block specific IPs, domains, or ports.  
   - Apply throttling rules for bandwidth.  
   - Whitelisting critical services.  

4. **Alerts & Notifications**  
   - Email/SMS alerts for suspicious traffic spikes.  
   - Threshold-based rules.  

5. **Reports**  
   - Daily/weekly usage summaries.  
   - Export in CSV/PDF.  

6. **User Management**  
   - Role-based access control.  
   - Authentication (username/password, optional LDAP).  

### 3.2 Non-Functional Requirements  
- **Performance**: Must process data packets with <200ms latency.  
- **Scalability**: Support up to 1000+ devices in enterprise network.  
- **Security**: All data encrypted (AES-256 for storage, TLS for transit).  
- **Reliability**: 99.5% uptime requirement.  
- **Usability**: Intuitive dashboard UI.
