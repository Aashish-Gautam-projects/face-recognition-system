## 1. Introduction  

### 1.1 Purpose  
The purpose of this project is to build an **AI-powered security guard system** using CCTV (or webcam for prototype). The system will:  
- Recognize faces in **live video streams** or **recorded CCTV footage**.  
- Maintain a **database of registered individuals** (Name, ID, Course, etc.).  
- Detect suspicious activities (e.g., glass breaking, vandalism, unauthorized entry).  
- Allow **manual photo input** to search for an individual in past recordings.  

### 1.2 Scope  
This project will help educational institutions, offices, and residential areas improve security by automatically identifying people and logging activities.  
- **Users**: Security guards, administrators.  
- **System Functions**:  
  - Live face recognition.  
  - Offline search from CCTV recordings.  
  - Database management of individuals.  
  - Suspicious activity detection & alert system.

## 2. STAR Analysis  

### Situation  
Security guards manually monitor CCTV feeds, making it inefficient to identify suspects or unusual behavior.  

### Task  
Automate face recognition, suspicious activity detection, and searching through recorded video.  

### Action  
- Implement OpenCV + Deep Learning for face recognition.  
- Store metadata (FaceID, Name, Course, Time, Location).  
- Integrate with a simple dashboard for search and alerts.  

### Result  
- Reduced workload for guards.  
- Faster identification of suspects.  
- Enhanced security and better logging of activities.

   - Store attendance/activity logs.  

4. **Activity Detection**  
   - Identify suspicious activities like vandalism or unauthorized access.  
   - Trigger alert (sound/email notification).  

---

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

Perfect Rishi ðŸš€â€”youâ€™ve already built a fantastic **SRS draft**.  
What Iâ€™ll do now is:  

1. Convert it into a **properly formatted `.md` (Markdown) document**.  
2. Add **more explanation, detailing, and technical clarity** so that it can directly act as project documentation (useful for research papers, GitHub repos, or reports).  

Hereâ€™s the detailed **SRS in Markdown code**:
